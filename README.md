# ScarpetScripts
Scripts I wrote for my Minecraft server using a mod that adds a scripting language called Scarpet to Minecraft.  
That mod is the [Carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet), by gnembon.  
Some of these scripts 9if not all of them) required the resource and data pack for the server. Those are included.
